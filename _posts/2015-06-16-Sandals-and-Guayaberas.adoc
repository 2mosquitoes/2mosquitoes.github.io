= Sandals and Guayaberas

==== We are moving to Puerto Rico at the beginning of July
Had you asked either one of us two months ago what our plans were, this would not have been it. We both felt settled in our jobs and in the city. Cassandra and I had begun talking about purchasing a home and we were saving to make it happen. She hosted regular brunches in our tiny apartment and I was quite deep into my cataloguing of San Francisco's dive bars. We were comfortable.

==== It all happened very suddenly
My mother invited Cassandra and I to Cancun, Mexico in May. It was a fantastic trip for me; my first time traveling to this country. The Mayan temples were spectacular. We ate tamales verdes, cotija, chicharron, and morcilla at the mercado. And of course we spent time on the beautiful beaches.

My mother and I also had some late afternoon conversations about my grandmother and our properties back home. Neither were doing well. It became clear to both of us that we neeed someone back home we could trust. Someone who understood our family situation and assets. Someone who could put everything in order. No small feat for that person as everything operates on island time over there.

Honestly it would be best if it was my mother or me. But no, neither of us could do it. Logistically it would be a nightmare. Can you imagine coordinating court visits and property inspections and government office appointments with our vacations and airplane schedules and end of quarter/end of semester madness?!?! The only way one of use could do it is if we lived in Puerto Rico fulltime. Wait a second...

Some things fell in place:

1. My family needs someone to put things in order back on the island
2. Cassandra and I are ready for something new
3. I have the luxury of working from anywhere with an internet connection

==== And so after some discussion we decided to go for it.
Cassandra quit her job. I'm transfering to contracting. We canceled the internet last week.

Cassandra bought a Puerto Rico guide book. I reorganized our closet five times in two weeks. We started a Puerto Rico themed Pinterest.

Most of our furniture was sold on Craigslist. Everything has been seperated into several piles:

* Going to Puerto Rico
* Going to storage
* Selling on Craigslist
* Going to the Mission Shelter
* Going to Goodwill

We've had some friends come by and grab things too. It is amazing how much stuff you can cram in a 600 square foot apartment...

==== Time to put up or shut up
Frequent flyer points are fantastic. You can obviously use them to purchase flights and hotels. A few years ago we outfitted our entire New York kitchen with them. You can use them for rental cars; something we're doing until we purchase a car out there. You cannot use them to rent a moving truck though...

We will be staying in a condo in Carolina until we figure out the next steps with things back in Rincon. In addition to the car I need to get some reliable internet access for work. Cassandra is doing online machete shopping.

We will be touring the properties and taking notes on what needs to be fixed. There's a fence that needs to be mended on one of the properties. On another is a 100 year old wooden home that I understand is infested by bats and has two bee hives. The farm land has quite a number of fruit trues and vegetables on it that need to be cared for.

It definitely will not be comfortable. But it's going to be great fun.
